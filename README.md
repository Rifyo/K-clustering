# K-clustering
# Goal: 
Write an implementation of k-clustering in python code for n-number of datapoints and k-number of clusters to gain greater insight into machinelearning. Input method will be random selection of centroids.

Version 0.1 - Implementation of special case for k = 2 clusters.
Version 0.2 - Generalization of code into any k of clusters
