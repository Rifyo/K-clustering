# K-clustering
# Goal: 
Write an implementation of k-clustering in python code for n-number of datapoints and k-number of clusters to gain greater insight into machinelearning. Input method will be random selection of centroids.

Version 0.1 - Implementation of special case for k = 2 clusters and n = 10 data points.

Version 0.2 - Generalization of code into any k of clusters and any n of datapoints.

Version 0.3 - Implement K-means++ algorithm as chooser of initial centroid location

Version 0.4 - Add feature of importing or specifying custom datapoints

Version 0.5 - UI?
